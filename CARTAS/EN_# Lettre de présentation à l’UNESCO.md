## Introduction

I address you as an independent researcher, author of the Einstein-VED theory — a rigorous scientific proposal that seeks to reconcile Einstein’s special relativity with quantum mechanics through a geometric and causal reformulation of space-time.

This theory is not merely a physical contribution. It is also an ethical and educational testimony. I have always believed that science must be accessible, responsible, and at the service of humanity. My goal is that anyone, even with minimal knowledge of physics and intellectual curiosity, can understand the scope of these ideas and explore reality without barriers.

## Ethical and Documentary Commitment

- All my documents are published in **open access** and available in **Spanish, French, and English**, structured in Markdown format to be readable and accessible to blind individuals.  
- Each work includes full references, DOI on Zenodo, ORCID, and web links, ensuring **academic transparency and traceability**.  
- My intention is to **share, disseminate, and debate** in an ethical, open, accessible, and empathetic manner, fostering curiosity and critical thinking.  
- For decades, I have maintained an active commitment to **global justice**, particularly in the prevention of genocides and the restoration of dignity to oppressed peoples, including the Palestinian people.

## Request

At 70 years of age, retired, I seek neither personal recognition nor institutional affiliation. My sole wish is that this work — the result of a life dedicated to **rigorous thought and compassion** — may be read, understood, and transmitted.

Therefore, I propose that my work and its complementary documents be considered by UNESCO within the framework of the *Memory of the World* program, or as an example of **open, ethical, multilingual, and accessible science**.

I attach to this letter the complete documents in **Spanish, French, and English**, along with their Markdown and PDF files and Zenodo links. I remain available for any review, dialogue, or clarification you may deem appropriate.

**With respect and hope,**
