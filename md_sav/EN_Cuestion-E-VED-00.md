## Introduction

The Einstein-VED theory proposes a geometric and relativistic interpretation of quantum phenomena, based on the principles of Einstein's relativity and on a **global wavefront** shared by all particles involved.

Unlike quantum mechanics (QM), Einstein-VED does not postulate fundamental probabilities nor wavefunction collapse: the observed indeterminacy is merely a consequence of projecting the complete structure of the system onto the space-time parameters of a limited observer.

---

## Shared Proper Time and Correlations

- All particles from a wavefront generated at \(t_0\) share a common **proper time** \(\tau\)
- This proper time does not depend on the observer's time or space
- Correlations between entangled particles emerge **naturally and deterministically** from the coherence of the wavefront

### Implications

1. **No superluminal communication:** correlations do not require information transmission between separated particles
2. **No local hidden variables:** the correlation arises from the global structure of the wavefront, not from hidden parameters
3. **The apparent non-locality of quantum mechanics** is explained as the projection of a continuous geometric reality onto the observer's reference frames

---

## Critique of Quantum Probability

Quantum mechanics interprets the wavefunction as a fundamental probabilistic object. Einstein-VED clarifies:

- **Classical probability:** quantifies what we do not know
- **Quantum probability:** is applied even when the state is completely defined (Ψ known), generating an epistemological contradiction
- **Einstein-VED solution:** the observed indeterminacy is simply the observer's lack of information about the complete structure in \(\tau\)
- The wavefunction collapse is not a physical process: it is an update of the observer's knowledge reflecting coherence with the global geometry

---

## Quantum Correlations Without Collapse or Signaling

Consider a particle pair with outcomes \(A,B\in\{+1,-1\}\) and measurement orientations \(a,b\):

\[
P(A,B \mid a,b,\tau) = \frac{1}{4}\left(1 + C(a,b,\tau) AB \right)
\]

- Marginalizing over \(B\) or \(A\) yields:

\[
P_A(A \mid a) = \sum_B P(A,B \mid a,b) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad P_B(B \mid b) = \frac{1}{2}
\]

- The observed correlations are:

\[
E(a,b) = \langle AB \rangle = \int d\mu(\tau) C(a,b,\tau)
\]

If we choose \(C(a,b,\tau) = -\cos(\alpha - \beta)\), we obtain exactly the singlet state correlation, **without violating causality or introducing collapse**.

---

## Conceptual Advantages of Einstein-VED

1. Naturally explains quantum correlations that are "magic" for quantum mechanics
2. Eliminates the need for hidden variables and collapse
3. Maintains relativistic covariance: predictions do not depend on the observer's space-time foliation
4. Allows for establishing falsifiable predictions: deviations from correlations can arise if the shared proper time is manipulated or the wavefront coherence is altered

---

## Conclusion

Einstein-VED provides a deterministic and geometric interpretation of quantum phenomena, respecting relativity and eliminating conceptual contradictions of quantum mechanics.

The theory transforms apparent indeterminacy into **observational ignorance**, and turns entanglement and non-locality into **natural consequences of the geometric continuity** of physical systems.

# Expansion of Proper Time and Mass in the Einstein-VED Theory

## Context

Within the Einstein-VED theory, all particles from a wavefront generated at \(t_0\) share a common proper time \(\tau\).

This naturally explains quantum correlations without resorting to hidden variables or wavefunction collapse.

A new aspect arises when considering the **presence of mass and particle velocity**.

---

## Velocity Limit and Proper Time

- For moving particles, the following holds:
\[
v = \frac{ds}{dt}
\]
- In the relativistic limit \(v \to c = 1\) (in our units), the differential of proper time tends to zero:
\[
dt' \to 0
\]
- However, **the presence of mass guarantees** that \(v < 1\), ensuring a proper time \(\tau > 0\)
- Mass also implies acceleration in the environment:
\[
\frac{d^2 s}{dt^2} \neq 0
\]

---

## Expanded Proper Time Field

Due to the finite velocity and the acceleration associated with mass, the **observed proper time "expands"** as a function of velocity and acceleration:

\[
d\tau = F(v, a)
\]

where:

- \(v = ds/dt\) is the particle velocity
- \(a = d^2 s/dt^2\) is the acceleration in the environment
- \(F\) is a **scalar field** defined over the wavefront that describes the local evolution of proper time

This field can be considered as a **new object of study**, connecting mass, motion, and the geometry of the wavefront.

---

## Consequences

1. **No absolute time:** proper time depends locally on the velocity and acceleration of each particle
2. **Emergent relativistic effects:** time dilation and other phenomena associated with velocity and mass are naturally derived from the wavefront geometry
3. **Influence on correlations:** particles with mass and acceleration modify the propagation of their wavefront, which can dynamically affect correlations without the need for superluminal interaction
4. **Continuous observational field:** this approach allows describing the evolution of proper time and its effects on entangled systems in a deterministic and geometric manner, without resorting to ontological probabilities

---

## Future Directions

The study of \(F(v, a)\) opens possibilities such as:

- Quantitatively deriving how acceleration affects wavefront coherence
- Establishing predictions about deviations in quantum correlations for accelerated particles
- Exploring connections with relativistic and cosmological phenomena from a unified framework

This development naturally integrates **mass, velocity, and acceleration** into the Einstein-VED theory, extending its scope beyond quantum correlations.
