## 1. Abstract

A conceptual framework is proposed where particles are not points, but **space-time cylinders** extended along their complete temporal history.  

- All instants are real, forming a four-dimensional object in $\mathbb{R}^4$.  
- Physical properties emerge from a countable series of **discrete foldings**, $T_n$, with $n \in \mathbb{N}$.  

Interpretation of foldings:  

- $n = 2$: matter/antimatter duality and electric charge  
- $n = 3$: color charge and confinement  

This approach unifies the **continuous** (worldline) and the **discrete** (foldings), offering an arithmetic-geometric framework for fundamental symmetries.

## 2. Worldline as Cylinder

Let a particle whose temporal history be described as a **space-time cylinder**, called $\Gamma$.  

$$
\Gamma = \{ (x, y, z, t) \mid (x, y, z) \in \Sigma(t), \ t \in \mathbb{R} \}
$$

**Verbal description for transcription:**

- $\Gamma$ is the set of all quadruples $(x, y, z, t)$, where $t$ spans all real numbers.  
- For each instant $t$, the particle occupies the spatial section $\Sigma(t)$ in three-dimensional space.  
- Conceptually, $\Sigma(t)$ represents the particle's location in R³ at that instant.  
- The particle does not appear or disappear: it exists at all instants of $\Gamma$.  

**Key properties:**

1. All points of $\Gamma$ are real, independent of the observation instant $t_0$.  
2. Each instant $t_0$ defines an **observable slice**, $\Sigma(t_0)$.  
3. Complete existence extends throughout the entire temporal history.

## 3. Discrete Foldings of Space-Time

Discrete transformations are defined:

$$
T_n : \mathbb{R}^4 \rightarrow M_n, \quad n \in \mathbb{N}, n \ge 1
$$

**Verbalization:**

- Each $T_n$ takes the complete space-time and generates a new "fold" or symmetry, denoted $M_n$.  
- Each $T_n$ acts upon the entire worldline $\Gamma$, not just at one instant.  
- Physical properties emerge from these folds.

### 3.1 Level n = 1

- Flat space-time, no foldings.  
- The worldline exists, but no polarity or color.

### 3.2 Level n = 2: Temporal Folding

- A splitting over the temporal dimension is introduced: $t \mapsto t^+$ and $t \mapsto t^-$.  
- This generates:
  - Matter/antimatter duality  
  - Electric polarity $+/-$  
  - U(1) symmetry  

- **Equation verbalization:**  
  "Each time t splits into two branches, positive t and negative t, representing matter and antimatter."

### 3.3 Level n = 3: Spatial Folding

- Involves the three spatial directions $x, y, z$.  
- Each direction generates a **discrete coupling mode** with the particle's temporal existence.  
- These three modes correspond to the **three colors** of QCD: red, green, and blue.  

**Confinement:** only the combination of all three modes reproduces the complete symmetry and is observable.  

- **Topological restriction verbalization:**  
  Sigma_complete(t) = Sigma_red(t) ∪ Sigma_green(t) ∪ Sigma_blue(t)  
  "The union of the three color sections at each instant t is the physically observable form of the particle."

## 4. Correspondence with Symmetry Groups

Level n | Folded Over | Symmetry Group | Physical Manifestation  
---------|-------------|----------------|----------------------  
1       | None        | —              | Flat space-time  
2       | Temporal dimension | U(1)     | Electric charge, matter/antimatter  
3       | Three spatial dimensions | SU(3) | Color charge, confinement  
4       | Complete space-time | ? | Possible unification or quantum gravity  

- Each $T_n$ is interpreted as a **principal bundle** with structural group $G_n$.  
- The SU(3) generators correspond to the three spatial dimensions x, y, z.

**Verbalization:**

- A principal bundle is an object that assigns to each point of $\mathbb{R}^4$ a set of fibers with symmetry $G_n$.  
- The action of $G_n$ on the fiber determines how physical properties (like color) manifest.

---

## 5. Formalization of Confinement

Let Sigma(t) be the spatial section of a quark with color $c_i$.  

- Only the combination of all three colors is observable:

$$
\Sigma_{\text{complete}}(t) = \Sigma_{\text{red}}(t) \cup \Sigma_{\text{green}}(t) \cup \Sigma_{\text{blue}}(t)
$$

- **Verbalization:**  
  "Sigma complete at time t is the union of the red, green, and blue color sections. Only this combination can be physically observed; an isolated color cannot exist."

---

## 6. Consequences and Predictions

1. Geometric interpretation of color confinement.  
2. Direct relationship between spatial three-dimensionality and color charge.  
3. Coupling constants as topological invariants of the foldings.  
4. Conceptual framework for extensions n > 3 and possible unification with quantum gravity.

---

## 7. Continuity and Discreteness

- The Gamma worldline is continuous in R⁴.  
- The T_n foldings introduce **discrete levels** that generate symmetries and observable properties.  
- The continuous (Gamma) and discrete (foldings) combine into an **arithmetic-geometric framework**.

---

## 8. Conclusion

- The particle is a **space-time cylinder**, real at all instants.  
- Matter/antimatter, electric polarity, and color emerge from space-time geometry and its discrete foldings.  
- The proposal unifies continuity and discreteness and offers a geometric interpretation of fundamental symmetries.

> "Space does not contain matter; matter is geometry itself, folded along its entire temporal history."

# Complete Narrative Framework: Particles, Antiparticles and Energy Reduction

## 1. Introduction

- A geometric particle framework is proposed where each particle is represented as a space-time cylinder in four real dimensions, not as a point.  
- This framework describes temporal persistence and spatial interaction of particles and antiparticles continuously.  
- The postulates are consistent with relativity and particle physics, offering a novel approach to modeling annihilation and energy transformation.

---

## 2. Fundamental Postulates

### 2.1 Worldline and Spatial Section

- Each particle has a worldline.  
- The first particle has worldline called Gamma one. Gamma one consists of all quadruples of the form: position X, position Y, position Z, and time t, for all real values of t.  
- The second particle has worldline Gamma two, defined analogously.  
- The spatial section of the first particle at instant t is called Sigma one of t.  
- The spatial section of the second particle at the same instant is called Sigma two of t.  
- For almost all time t, Sigma one of t and Sigma two of t do not overlap, meaning no complete coincidence in three-dimensional space.

### 2.2 Energy Reduction of Spatial Structure

- If there exists a critical instant t_critical such that Sigma one of t_critical equals Sigma two of t_critical, **energy reduction of spatial structure** or **resolutive expansion of particular space** occurs.  
- The spatial section transforms, releasing energy, while the temporal dimension persists.

### 2.3 Temporal Persistence Function f

- Function f takes the union of both particle worldlines and produces the remaining worldline, called Gamma_remaining.  
- This ensures temporal existence continues even when spatial structure transforms.  
- Function f also determines how released energy is distributed along the remaining worldline.

### 2.4 Application to Particles and Antiparticles

- Particles and antiparticles are complementary structures.  
- If Sigma of particle coincides with Sigma of antiparticle at t_critical, energy reduction of spatial structure occurs.  
- This geometrically formalizes matter-antimatter annihilation and energy release.

---

## 3. Released Energy

- Let rho be the energy density associated with the spatial section at critical instant t_critical.  
- Local energy at critical instant is obtained by summing all energy density in the coincident spatial section.  
- For particles with masses m_one and m_two, energy density approximates sum of masses multiplied by speed of light squared, concentrated at coincidence position.  
- Total released energy approximates sum of masses times c²: released energy approximately equal to (m_one plus m_two) times c squared.  

**Narrative interpretation:**  
- All particle mass converts to energy at instant of spatial coincidence.

---

## 4. Temporal Energy Distribution

- Function f allows distributing released energy along remaining worldline.  
- Before critical instant t_critical, released energy is zero.  
- After t_critical, function f indicates what fraction of energy releases at each instant.  
- This enables modeling progressive or gradual energy release over time.

## 5. Consequences and Contributions

1. Geometric formalization of particles and antiparticles as space-time cylinders, including complete temporal history.  
2. Spatial exclusion with temporal persistence, avoiding complete overlap while maintaining temporal continuity.  
3. Energy reduction of spatial structure, offering geometric framework for matter-antimatter annihilation.  
4. Temporal persistence function f, novel for modeling energy redistribution over time.  
5. Geometric energy release estimation, consistent with E equals m times c squared.  
6. Conceptual application to high-energy physics and cosmology, useful for extreme collisions and high densities.

## 7. Conclusion

- Directly connects with known physical phenomena, but provides **a more complete geometric interpretation**, accessible for future theoretical research.
