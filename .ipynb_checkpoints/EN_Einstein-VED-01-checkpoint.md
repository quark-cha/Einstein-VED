## Introduction

The **VED Theory** I present proposes an explanation of quantum entanglement, derived from Einstein's relativity. This theory complements the Special Theory of Relativity. Supported by a geometric reinterpretation and the development of Lorentz transformations.

## Figure 1: Space-Time Geometric Representation

**Description for visually impaired people:**
This figure represents an original geometric deduction of space-time made from Lorentz equations, first published in 2000 and maintained until today (2025). The diagram shows a right triangle where the hypotenuse represents the observer's time differential (dt), the vertical leg represents the observed object's time differential (dm or dt'), and the horizontal leg represents the spatial separation between observer and observed (ds). The mathematical relationship is $dt^2 = ds^2 + dm^2$. For particles moving at light speed, dm tends to zero, meaning all share the same proper time t₀, explaining quantum entanglement as simultaneity in proper space-time.

---

## Fundamental Postulate

Three differentials associated with space-time are defined:

- **dt**: time flow in the observer
- **dm**: time flow in the observed or moving object (dm = dt')
- **ds**: flow of separation (space) between observer and observed

Units are unified in seconds:
- Time in **time-seconds**
- Length in **length-seconds**
- With $C = 1$ ($ds/dt = 1$)

---

## Relation with Lorentz Equations

For one-dimensional motion (only X coordinate):

$$dt^2 = ds^2 + dm^2$$

where:
- **dm** = proper time of the moving object (observed)
- **dm** is used instead of dt' to emphasize the geometric interpretation

## Quantum Entanglement and Relativity

The theory reconciles entanglement with Special Relativity:

- In a photonic wavefront, all particles share the same emission time $t_0$
- For a photon, proper time between emission and detection is null:

$$t = t_0 + dm \quad \text{where} \quad dm \to 0 \Rightarrow t = t_0$$

- The **observer** measures detection at $t_1$
- The **photon** remains anchored at $t_0$, without evolution or collapse

**Conclusion:**
Entanglement and superposition are interpreted as a relativistic consequence: particles remain in their origin time and the observer only accesses that state from their own space-time framework.

## Geometric Foundation

### Differential notation
- **dt**: observer's proper time
- **dm**: moving object's proper time
- **ds**: relativistic invariant (space-time line differential)
- **dx, dy, dz**: spatial differentials

In light-seconds units:
$$dt^2 = (dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2) + dm^2$$

For one-dimensional motion:
$$dt^2 = ds^2 + dm^2$$

**Key:** In relativistic trajectories, $dm \to 0$, keeping the particle bound to the emission instant.

### Time as cause of motion
- Time differences generate motion
- Motion as consequence of temporal inequalities

$$ds^2 = dt^2 - dm^2$$

### Unit unification
- Time in **seconds**
- Length in **length-seconds**
- $C = 1$ (no conversions needed)

### Geometric interpretation of Lorentz

Relativistic transformation:
$$\frac{dt'}{dt} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{V^2}{c^2}}$$

With $C = 1$:
$$dt^2 = dt'^2 + dx^2$$

Interpretation:
- **Hypotenuse** = passage of time in the observer
- **Leg 1** = proper time in the moving object
- **Leg 2** = traveled distance

---

## Synthesis and Conclusions

Einstein-VED Theory:

- Provides a geometric and deterministic basis
- Explains space as differences in the temporal dimension
- Interprets quantum entanglement as conservation of particles' space-time origin
- Respects the mathematical structure of Lorentz and Special Relativity

## Step-by-step deduction for particles at c

1. Particle travels at $V = ds/dt = 1$
2. Proper time differential:

$$dm^2 = dt^2 - ds^2$$

3. Since $ds = dt$:

$$dm^2 = dt^2 - dt^2 = 0 \Rightarrow dm \to 0$$

## Absolute proper time of the particle:

$$t_{\text{proper}} = t_2 + dm = t_2$$

## Conclusion (1): the **particle's time remains anchored**, simultaneous for all particles in the wavefront, while the observer measures normal intervals ($dt \neq 0$)

---

## Implications for relativistic entanglement

- Correlation between particles **requires no action at distance nor collapse**
- Emerges from **absolute simultaneity of proper time** in the wavefront
- All particles sharing the same proper space-time deterministically explains why **the observer can measure correlations even between antipodal particles**

---

## Conclusion (2)

1. **Time and space are not independent**; their relationship is determined by the intrinsic geometry of space-time
2. **Differentials viewed from the observer** allow access to the moving object's proper space-time
3. Quantum entanglement is interpreted as a **manifestation of simultaneous proper time** in a wavefront
4. The theory provides a **deterministic and geometric explanation** of entanglement, fully respecting special relativity and the Lorentz metric

## Space-time geometric representation

![Graphic showing how observed system velocity affects space-time geometry](https://estradad.es/teorias/img/espacio/es_tiempo.gif)

**Accessible description for blind people:**
This graphic shows how the observed system's velocity modifies space-time geometry from the observer's viewpoint. Two axes are represented: horizontal for space and vertical for time. At increasing velocities of the observed system, its trajectory inclines toward the space axis, losing orthogonality with the observer's time axis. This inclination represents the loss of independence between space and time, and the emergence of an interdependent geometric structure.

## Independence of time and space

This relationship can be clearly seen in the geometric interpretation of my theory though we can see it emerge from this development's consistency.

What is the dimensional explanation of independence?
- Two or more dimensions are independent when they are orthogonal.

In our geometric description, when are space and time orthogonal?
- Only when the hypotenuse is vertical, when $ds = 0$, meaning only when $V = ds/dt = 0$
- Meaning there's only space-time independence when relative motion is zero.

Moreover, we should already know this: whenever there's velocity $V = ds/dt$ we're implicitly stating that time and space are not independent. Isn't velocity itself a space-time relationship?

Thus whenever there's velocity, dimensional independence is broken and since this is the case, you cannot fix one without altering the other because they become dependent.
